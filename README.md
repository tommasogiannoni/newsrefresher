A simple and efficient web application built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, 
designed to display the top 10 news stories at a time. 
Users can refresh the news to load a new set of 10 news articles, 
ensuring they always have access to the latest updates. 
The news is fetched from an API that retrieves articles from CNN. 
This application is developed for non-professional purposes to test and showcase my development skills 
with JavaScript and related technologies.

## Run Application

- git clone the project.
- go to the project root and run `http-server`
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
